        <dt><strong>History of Tennis</strong></dt><br>
        <dd>The History of tennis match-up was created from a 12th century French
          handball match-up called "Paume" (palm). In this game the ball was hit with the hand.
          After some time "Paume" game created handball "Jeu de Paume" (game of the palm)
          and there were utilized rackets. The game was first made by European priests for
          diversion jobs during stylized events. From the outset, the ball was hit with hands.
          Afterward, the leather glove appeared. This glove was supplanted with a versatile
          handle for compelling hitting and serving of the ball. That was a birth of tennis racket.<br><br>
          Advancement of tennis racket, tennis balls likewise went through successive adjustments. First
          tennis ball was from wood. Later throughout the entire existence of tennis ball was loaded up
          with cellulose material to offered approach to a bouncier. Priests from all spaces of Europe
          supported "Jeu de Paume" game during the 14th century much to the dismay of the mother Church.
          The game spread and developed in Europe.<br>
          <br>The game turned out to be exceptionally famous, particularly in France, where was taken on
          by the royal family. That is when it started to be called Royal Tennis in Great Britain, or
          Court Tennis in the United States.<br>
          <br>In 1968, business tensions and rumors about certain beginners taking cash under the table
          prompted the surrender of this qualification, introducing the "Open Era", in which every player
          could contend in all competitions, and top players had the option to make their living from tennis.
          With the start of the Open Era, the foundation of a global expert tennis circuit, and incomes
          from the offer of TV privileges, tennis' notoriety has spread around the world, and the game
          has shed its upper/working class image.
